This project involves creating a simplified clone of the YouTube website using HTML and CSS. The primary focus is on replicating the layout and style of YouTube, featuring key components such as a navigation bar, video playback area,  recommended videos sidebar, and a comments section. The HTML structure lays out the basic framework of the website, while CSS is used extensively to style elements to closely match YouTube's design, including colors, fonts, and layout grids. This clone is designed as a static web page, primarily for educational purposes to demonstrate web development skills and understanding of responsive design principles.
